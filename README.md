# BlockPickStick
Mobile devices are not able to block-pick in Minecraft due to the fact they don't have a mousewheel to click.
Thanks to API improvements during PocketMine-MP 4.0 development, you can now use this plugin instead.

## Requirements
- PocketMine-MP 4.0 @ d456cb24196b5bffe595de5a12dff0b45709f528 or newer

## Commands
| Command | Permission | Description |
|:--------|:-----------|:------------|
| `/bpstick` | `bpstick.command` | Gives the user a block-picking stick |

## Usage
Tap on any block with a block-picking stick. The behaviour is identical to performing a middle-click on a desktop.
